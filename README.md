# RayStationScripts

This script takes in a patient list and exports them. Sometimes it doesn't export the patient for a single patient given. 
In Raystation go to scripting on the left-hand-side and select create script. Then open this file. Select mda_cp36 python interpreter. 
Edit the export file location in the script if you would like.
Run script.
